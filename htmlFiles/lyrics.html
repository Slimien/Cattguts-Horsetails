                    <br>
                    I have a problem with bodily odeur<br>
                    and my hair does not shine like before<br>
                    I say all the wring things even when I try my best<br>
                    People shun me like I am a pest<br>
                    <br>
                    I never can help but to let out a fart<br>
                    People want to be two meters apart<br>
                    Social distance is all that I’ve seen<br>
                    People treat me like I’m covid-19<br>
                    <br>
                    I never had a friend in my life<br>
                    not counting those I threatened with a knife<br>
                    so if you come close to me just a second of the night<br>
                    I will cling to you like a parasite<br>
                    <br>
                    My rumour precedes me, people know<br>
                    that I am exactly what they see<br>
                    When I start conversations, people answer me real vague<br>
                    and they look at me like I am the Plague<br>
                    <br>
                    Folks turn away at the smell of my breath<br>
                    like the air would induce their death<br>
                    If I come to near, nervous smiles will increase<br>
                    like I am a contagious disease <br>
                    <br>
                    I never had a friend in my life<br>
                    not counting those I threatened with a knife<br>
                    so if you come close to me just a second of the night<br>
                    I will cling to you like a parasite

                    (Trekkspel-intro)<br>
                    <br>
                    It was finally Friday<br>
                    I needed a drink<br>
                    Life is a party<br>
                    and I’d been banging my shrink<br>
                    I put on my best dress<br>
                    and drank me some rum<br>
                    I walked down the street and<br>
                    I started to hum:<br>
                    <br>
                    The night’s when I go out to play <br>
                    Let other people keep the day <br>
                    I’ll drink ‘till I am proper drunk <br>
                    And dance with my badonkadonk <br>
                    <br>
                    I was loaded with cash <br>
                    and the night was still young <br>
                    I rocked my sweet outfit <br>
                    and wearing a thong <br>
                    The bar was before me <br>
                    I was thirsty as hell <br>
                    The bartender smiled <br>
                    He new what I liked well <br>
                    <br>
                    He poured me a whiskey <br>
                    and I studied his ass <br>
                    It looked as refined as <br>
                    what was in my glass <br>
                    I yelled “Hey good lookin’, <br>
                    let’s go hump in the john!” <br>
                    Then for some strange reason <br>
                    he wanted me gone <br>
                    <br>
                    The night… <br>
                    <br>
                    I stopped by a table <br>
                    there was people drinking wine <br>
                    I took a glass and drank it <br>
                    Some lady said “that’s mine!” <br>
                    I reached for more <br>
                    but stumbled to the floor <br>
                    A nice man helped me up <br>
                    and then kicked me out the door <br>
                    <br>
                    (klagesang)x2 <br>
                    <br>
                    The night… x2 <br>
                    <br>
                    I sat down to smoke <br>
                    A girl asked me for a light <br>
                    I chivalrously offered it <br>
                    without giving her a fight <br>
                    I reached out a lit match <br>
                    made a glorious flare <br>
                    The flame avoided her cigarette <br>
                    but took a liking to her hair <br>
                    <br>
                    There was yelling and screaming <br>
                    as I admired the view <br>
                    There was something pretty about <br>
                    the burning hairs hue <br>
                    I luckily snapped out of it <br>
                    as a fist hit my face <br>
                    and decided to leave <br>
                    while I still had some grace <br>
                    <br>
                    The night… x2 <br>

                    Let the flames embrace my body,<br>
                    let them feast upon my flesh<br>
                    Let the smoke from this unholy fire spread<br>
                    from here to Marrakesh.<br>
                    I am no fucking daughter of Satan,<br>
                    I am the devils favourite lover<br>
                    so listen closely as I cast this curse,<br>
                    for it will stain your soul forever.<br>

                    <br>
                    Some people I have a disgust for.<br>
                    Some live, and some of them die.<br>
                    I’m not sure how all my potions worked out,<br>
                    that I made some, I will not deny.<br>
                    Your allegations are sometimes wild.<br>
                    You say that I killed a child.<br>
                    In this town children die,<br>
                    some still while they crawl<br>
                    I did certainly not kill them all.<br>
                    <br>
                    The clouds will hang over you thick and grey,<br>
                    you may never again see the light of day.<br>
                    Thunder and lightning will strike this town<br>
                    you will never be safe even if you stay home.<br>
                    <br>
                    Mr. Buckscott, you claim I killed your wife.<br>
                    but I swear upon my life<br>
                    that the potion of death that I brought to your house,<br>
                    was meant for you, not ever your spouse!<br>
                    I must admit that was a bit careless,<br>
                    but I’ve had my lesson learned<br>
                    so listen whilst <br>
                    my body burns<br>
                    here comes the curse I think you earned<br>
                    <br>
                    As never again anyone will love you<br>
                    no one will anymore touch you or hold you<br>
                    you will become more eager to drink<br>
                    and your little grey penis will shrivel and shrink<br>
                    <br>
                    My dear neighbour, you accuse me<br>
                     of killing your peartree,<br>
                    I must confess, wholeheartedly,<br>
                     that tree was bothering me.<br>
                    It took the sun for the best part of day,<br>
                    I could not let it stand in my way.<br>
                    By this much discussed peartree,<br>
                    more often than not,<br>
                    is where I emptied my chamber pot.<br>
                    <br>
                    My dear neighbour, you’ve upset me,<br>
                    and I can not let that go,<br>
                    so I damn your wondrous garden<br>
                    there will nothing ever grow<br>
                    your grass will turn to moss, and your roses will be brown<br>
                    and all the trees and bushes let their withered leaves fall down

                    AT LAST IT HAS COME TO THIS TIME OF YEAR.<br>
                    WHEN DARKNESS SURROUNDS US;<br>
                    CHRISTMAS IS HERE!<br>
                    <br>
                    When the sun goes down and you don’t see the day<br>
                    you know evil spirits are on their way.<br>
                    You know if they catch you, you won't get away<br>
                    so you light every window to keep them at bay.<br>
                    <br>
                    And all little children have something to fear<br>
                    as the most frightful creature is coming near<br>
                    if you did something naughty I’ll soon be there<br>
                    better do as you’re told this time of year<br>
                    <br>
                    I WILL LIFT YOU UP BY JUST ONE LEG<br>
                    AND PUT YOU INTO THIS STINKING OLD BAG!<br>
                    <br>
                    I love when you’re naughty to say the least,<br>
                    I need little souls for my christmas feast<br>
                    I don’t listen to pardons, I know what you did,<br>
                    because after all, I am a beast<br>

                    <br>
                    MY NAME IS KRAMPUS; AND I’VE COME FOR YOU<br>
                    WHO DID NOT DO WHAT YOU WERE TOLD TO DO<br>
                    <br>
                    Did you pick your nose? Put your hand in your hose?<br>
                    Did you pinch your little sister, or make too much noise?<br>
                    <br>
                    When you went to the toilet, did you wash your hands?<br>
                    If you said something rude, did you make amends?<br>
                    If not, little child, boo-hoo, boo-hoo<br>
                    you know the old Krampus is coming for you<br>
                    <br>
                    When the sun comes up and the night turns to day<br>
                    your mother will find you’ve been taken away<br>
                    no body will know what has happened to you<br>
                    they will simply forget you.<br>
                    Bo-hoo, bo-hoo.<br>
                    <br>
                    NAUGHTY CHILDREN; <br>
                    IT WILL NOT HELP YOU TO SLEEP WITH A LIGHT<br>

                    Virginia Lee<br>
                    <br>
This is the tale of Virginia Lee<br>
They found her dead body<br>
underneath an oak tree <br>
Her body was there <br>
but her spirit was not <br>
She knew what had happened <br>
She never forgot <br>
<br>
Her spirit was hungry<br> 
Her spirit was mean<br>
Her spirit would righten<br> 
the wrongs she had seen <br>
The ghost of Virginia <br>
had made up her mind <br>
She’d find all wrongdoers<br>
She wouldn’t be kind<br>
<br>
The fuckers would feel<br>
all the pain she had felt<br>
The fuckers would tremble<br>
At the force of her belt<br>
Her cold heart felt hot <br>
as she visioned their cries<br>
and how they would suffer<br>
because of their lies<br>

The first one she haunted<br> 
was a man they called Bart<br>
He popped her sweet cherry<br>
then broke her young heart <br>
For this heinous crime<br>
she’d him ride like a mare<br> 
Steal all of his sanity <br>
Leave nothing to spare<br>
<br>
Virginia Lee she showed mercy to none,<br>
and so Mary felt as her children was gone <br>
She had as a child told her<br>
“No, I won’t play”<br>
For this Mary’s kids<br>
would no more see the day <br>
<br>
As her effort in music<br> 
was graded with F<br>
her poor music teacher<br> 
would find herself deaf<br>
The dumb fuck who once stole her bicycle seat<br>
could bike ride no more <br>
‘cause she cut off his feet<br>

Virginias killer was trembling <br>
with fear<br>
He saw all that happened<br> 
around him so clear<br>
He begged for his life <br>
as Virginias ghost <br>
arrived in her chambers<br> 
and made him her host<br>
<br>
“Sweetheart forgive me”<br>
he cried on his knees <br>
“You know that I loved you,<br>
just spare my life please!”<br>
“You didn’t spare mine”<br>
she roared with rage from the deep<br>
“Now face your fate husband, you’re mine and you I’ll keep”<br>
<br>
As night turned to day<br>
our dark spirit was gone<br>
It seemed it was over <br>
She was finally done <br>
Her treacherous husband <br>
was nowhere to see<br>
And so ends our tale<br>
of Virginia Lee<br>
